I treated this as an experiment to create an interactive 3D art scene

What I used:   
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**
- **[React-three-fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)**
- **[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)**
- **[Blender](https://www.blender.org/)** for 3D models
- coffee :coffee:
